Important! The `commarobust` package is no longer in development. I'll leave this branch up in case folks want to still use it or have legacy code. But anything you could do in `commarobust` you can do much better in `estimatr`.

Install estimatr:

``` r
install.packages("estimatr")
```

If you need the legacy version of `commarobust`, use:

``` r
remotes::install_github("acoppock/commarobust", ref = "legacy")
```
